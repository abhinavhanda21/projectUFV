   <p>Our goal for this project is to enhace our  <a href="https://www.ufv.ca/">university</a> with the funds provided from our great leader Justin Trudeau. This entails by adding a new building which will include things like a better student welfare commitee, a cricket stadium and a developer club. </p>
                <p>This project benefits the University as it would be very good publicity and will atract more students as they'll be attracted and will feel safe at same time. Furthermore, it would be a benefit to the community through all the new jobs created. </p>
                    <p>Among the Prime minister, University and the city of Abbotsford, some other key stakeholders include the provincial government and cricket canada. It is important to consider the risks to this project, if there is no increase in student admission all the money we had spent on the prior steps will have no return on investment. </p>

                    <p>The construction site would cost $50million, the developer lab alone would take 100 million.</p>

                    <p>The developer lab will have around 1000 high end PCs, each PC would cost about $52000. Also, another $100,000 will be aloted for A.I. , robotics, web servers and other cloud computing services for students.</p>
                     <p>A $60,000,000 for cricket stadium and another $90,000 cricket kits, jersey and a cafeteria setup for energy drinks and quick meals. </p>

                     <p>This introduction of a new game would not only pull in a lot of talent but also help create a new ambition, a new career path for the students yet deciding their professional future. It would help empower the Cricket Industry.It'd also empower our University of Fraser Valley for offering such unique career opportunities.</p>

                    <p>There would be a lot of opportunities for the students who only love practical application of advance techonlogy subjects and have no interest to study other irrelevant courses which does not excite them. It would offer proper certifications and degrees for the relevant courses.</p>
                     <p>The weakness is being prominent in this plan is, of course, an ambitious workload in just over a year's time. We can obviously run into issues that make us not reach our expected time to live.</p>
                     <p> The threat to the proposed project would be people underestimating cricket as a profession, and not let their child enroll for a career in it. Also, people may not like the idea of getting there children into a certificate program over bachelor degree.</p>
